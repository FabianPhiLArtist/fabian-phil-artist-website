              <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                My artistic journey began not in an art school, but in the jungles of Brunei (2002-2006) as a geophysicist working with seismic waves. 
                Born into a family of art collectors, I was always drawn to what I was not yet - artists, philosophers, historians, 
                people who lived in the realm of ideas and emotions rather than data and equations.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                As an engineer studying business, I felt a magnetic pull toward creative expression. My first painting in Brunei in 2003 
                took me an entire year to complete - a single artwork that taught me the patience and dedication that art demands. 
                This was my introduction to the discipline of creation, far removed from the instant gratification of corporate life.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The breakthrough came by chance in Africa (2006-2010). Working with seismic waves, I sought to translate their movement and 
                transparency into visual art. I painted the Blue Lady twice on two plexiglass sheets in 2010, and something magical happened. 
                The vertical strokes created movement when you moved around the painting - the eyes followed you, like the Mona Lisa. 
                This was my discovery of kinetic pop art, born from the intersection of science and serendipity.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                After four challenging years in Iraq (2015-2019), where my work was physically and emotionally demanding, I aspired for more joy in my life. 
                I began painting pop glasses in fluorescent paint, exploring triptychs with 100 USD bills, and started mixing digital design 
                with traditional techniques, introducing cartoons, boxing themes, and fashion shows on catwalks. In 2025, seeking more peace 
                after leaving corporate life, I created pandas with zen Chinese landscapes - temples, lakes, cherry blossom trees - for a 
                peaceful, healing outcome.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                I am driven by emotions of the character. I try to capture the movement of eyes, sometimes the flow of air. 
                I love transparency, light, and movement because they bring energy and hope into our world. Each collection serves a purpose: 
                the pop glasses and currency art because we need more light in our lives, the pandas with beautiful landscapes because 
                we need more color and joy after what we see on TV.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                My art is not just visual - it's emotional, it's healing, it's a response to the world around us. It's a quiet, 
                peaceful environment after the chaos of my previous life, a refuge for both creator and viewer.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                I have always sought as a goal to become better than what I am. Attracted to people who speak well and tell stories - 
                historians, novelists, philosophers (my uncle), even counselors (my aunt) - I am also aspired by many historical novelists like Ken Follett, 
                Dos Santos, Lapierre & Collins and many others. I've negotiated complex contracts with multiple stakeholders in my corporate career, 
                always seeking to understand different perspectives. Never a handyman in my youth, I've started working with wood at my chalet 
                in the Alps (Chamonix/Meg√®ve), learning new skills and continuing to grow. I would love to know how to build a house.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                My artwork is a reflection of this constant self-improvement. I try to always improve and started painting on my own. 
                Each new series - from kinetic portraits to pop glasses, from currency art to zen pandas - represents growth and 
                exploration of new possibilities, always becoming better than what I am.
